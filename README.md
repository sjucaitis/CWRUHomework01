# Code Refactor

This project refactors existing code for greater web accessibility and cleaner, more efficient code. CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow the semantic structure of HTML elements. 

## User Story

As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our site is optimized for search engines. This code displays semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure, independent of styling and positioning. Image elements must have accessible alt attributes, heading attributes must fall in sequential order, and there must be a concise, descriptive title.
